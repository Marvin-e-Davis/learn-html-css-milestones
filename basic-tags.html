  <h2>Block Level Elements</h2>

  <p>Block level elements are elements that take up the entire width
    of a webpage and inherenetly cause an line break</p>

  <blockquote>In HTML programming, a block-level element is any element that
  starts a new line (e.g., paragraph) and uses the full width of the page or
  container. A block-level element can take up one line or multiple lines and
  has a line break before and after the element.</blockquote>
