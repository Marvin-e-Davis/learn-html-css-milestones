<h1>Tags in the Snippet</h1>
<p>The tags in the snippet are a paragraph tag and an anchor tag.</p>

<div>
<a href = "https://html.com/anchors-links/"
target="_blank">Online Reference 1</a>
</div>

<div>
<a href ="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p#:~:text=The%20HTML%20element%20represents,as%20images%20or%20form%20fields."
target="_blank">Online Reference 2</a>
</div>

<p>In the snippet the anchor tag is a child of the paragraph tag. This can be determined
by observing how the anchor tag starts and ends inside of the paragraph tag before
the paragraph tag ends. Therefore anchor is a child of paragraph.</p>

<p> The open paragraph tag indicates the beginning of the element which allows
text to be written inside of it and then displayed on the webpage. The closed
paragraph tag indicates the end of the paragraph element and encloses all of the text
written. Any text written after the closed tag will not be shown on a webpage.  </p>

<p>Some of the attributes on the anchor tag in the snippet are href class id and target. The href's
value is google.com, aka a hyperlink to google. The id's value is the-best-link, which acts as an
identifier for that specific element and can be used in various ways. The class element's value is
banana which acts as a more general identifier and can be used to easily apply CSS or
javascripts to the element. The attribute target's value is _blank which opens a new Window
when clicking on a hyperlink.</p>
