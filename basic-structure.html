<h1>This is the Basic Structure Page for my HTML/CSS Milestones</h3>

<p>HTML isn't that hard to code when you get used to it.</p>
<p>I think atom is also one of the most user friendly interfaces I've interacted with.</p>
<p>At first it was a bit intimidating but everything flows really well.</p>
<p>I dislike having to write a commit message though .... It's useful for groups but when coding alone
and approaching it the way I do it seems pointless</p>

<h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
<p>I don't really know what I expected before I started to code in HTML or CSS</p>
<p>It seems more intimidating than it actually is and the online documentation for
it is very extensive</p>
<p>I think high school should have an HTML course for interested people, while python is a
good starting point I feel HTML gives you the ability to make content with creativity and
not an super high amount of coding skills.</p>
<p>They will also able to immediately see the fruits of their labor</p>
